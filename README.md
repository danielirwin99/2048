Welcome to the 2048 game! 

This is a classic puzzle game where your goal is to combine tiles with the same number to reach the elusive 2048 tile. The game board consists of a 4x4 grid, and you can move the tiles in four directions: up, down, left, and right.

How to Play
Objective: The objective of the game is to merge tiles with the same number by sliding the entire grid in one of the four directions (up, down, left, or right). When two tiles with the same number collide while moving, they merge into one tile with their sum.

Controls: You can use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) or the W, A, S, D keys to move the tiles in the corresponding direction. Alternatively, if you are using a touch-screen device, you can swipe in the direction you want the tiles to move.

Game Over: The game is over when there are no more valid moves left (i.e., you can't move any tiles in any direction) or when you reach the 2048 tile.

Scoring: Your score is determined by the total value of all merged tiles during the game. Try to reach the highest score possible!
